# HashCode_Pizza_2020
Me Having fun trying to find a fast closer solution,I still have much to learn

## logic :
we are searching for the number n starting from a set of diffrent type of pizza's where we can only get only one from each type
my solution is deviding the n into n/2 , (n+2 +(rest)) we look for closer number to n/2 in the set of pizza, if its bigger than two times the number of slices  of biggest pizza we re do the same division /2 .
